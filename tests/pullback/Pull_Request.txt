Pull Request: Full Implementation of the Test Suite

OVERVIEW AND MOTIVATION
For the Django E-Commerce application, this PR introduces a test suite which consists of unit tests, automated user interface tests, and configuration for static code analysis. This PR does not contain any bug fixes or features for the application.
The testing effort behind this PR also involved manual exploratory testing, a session sheet of which is included.

The testing revealed multiple defects and issues, some which are documented in the issue list found below in this PR, in the test report in tests/reports/test_summary_report.md, and the rest in the added unit tests.
This PR also documents a few code quality issues, such as unreachable code and other code smells, found via manual inspection and static code analysis.

For the most complex parts of the code, decision tables are included in tests/reports/test_summary_report.md and tests/reports/PaymentViewTestMCDC.md.
According to Copeland [1], descision tables are a useful tool for testing when dealing with complex business rules.
The tables included in this PR should help maintainers of this project reason about the business rules and also see the state of the test coverage across their conditions.
For the most critical code paths used for checkout and payment, this PR adds tests with MC/DC, several of which fail with the current code.
Fixing most of these defects and issues would be necessary before using the software in production.

The identified pricing defects, including floating-point arithmetic errors and coupon calculation issues, raise concerns regarding regulatory compliance. Price verification standards established by consumer protection regulations (e.g., NIST Handbook 130 [2]) require pricing accuracy of at least 98% and identify overcharges and undercharges as violations.

Overall, merging these changes would be a crucial step in bringing the quality of the software closer to a production-ready state.

TEST COVERAGE ADDED

1. Robot Framework Tests (Black Box Testing)
End to end automated tests were created to cover:

Order Management: 
  - Empty Cart Confirmed
  - Adding/removing products from the cart
  - Incrementing/decrementing quantity of items in cart 
  - Cart is persistent across browser sessions
  - Cart is persistent after logout/login

Authentication: 
  - Successful login with a valid username and password
  - Users selecting to sign up with valid username and password
  - Negative path: users trying to sign up with an already existing username
  - Negative path: users trying to sign up with weak password (< 6 characters)
  - Negative path: users trying to login with invalid username
  - Negative path: users trying to login with invalid password
  - Negative path: users trying to login with no input 

Test Results: All Robot Framework tests passed.


2. Django Unit Tests (White Box Testing)

Model Tests (tests/test_models.py):
  - Complete testing for all models (Item, OrderItem, Order, Address, 
    Payment, Coupon, Refund, UserProfile)
  - 100% statement coverage achieved on core/models.py


Review of Tests (tests/test_views.py):

- CheckoutView: MC/DC (Modified Condition/Decision Coverage) testing with 
  13 test cases covering all conditional branches
- PaymentView: MC/DC testing of payment processing logic
- CouponView: Validating application of discount coupons
- RefundView: Form validation and processing tests
- 98% statement coverage achieved on core/views.py

3. Static Code Analysis Configuration

3.1 Pylint: 

Configuration files were added for code quality analysis. 
The analysis covered all main application modules under `core/` and project settings under `djecommerce/`.

- **Total statements analyzed:** 489
- **Total lines analyzed:** 915
- **Score:** 9.67/10 (Excellent)
- **Duplicated lines:** 0% (No duplication detected)
- **Documentation coverage:** ~18% of modules contain docstrings

This indicates a **high-quality and maintainable codebase**, with only minor style and complexity issues identified.

| **Refactor (R)**   | 7     | Opportunities to simplify functions (too complex / redundant `else` usage) |
| **Warning (W)**    | 2     | Unused function arguments detected                                         |
| **Error (E)**      | 0     | No syntax or logical errors found                                          |
| **Fatal (F)**      | 0     | None                                                                       |


3.2 SonarQube: 
- Integration set up for ongoing code quality control 
- Passed quality gate with an "A" rating in the "Security," "Reliability," and "Maintainability" categories
- Identified four security hotspots for review in the future

IDENTIFIED ISSUES (Not Fixed in This PR)

High Priority: 
- UnboundLocalError in checkout flow (when shipping is invalid and 
    billing address is same)
- No address validation on checkout, before reaching payment
- Invalid coupon application crashes request
- Anonymous user accessing payment view crashes
- Authorized refunds can be requested with known ref code

Medium Priority: 
- Login allows empty fields and does not provide feedback
- Coupon application without an active order enters an infinite redirect
- Invalid refund form submission crashes request.

Low Priority / UX Issues: 
- Discount not shown in checkout, only the discount price is displayed
- Country and zip code fields are not required
